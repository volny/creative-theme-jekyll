Linux Bridge
============

Introduction
------------

**Overview:** Virtual networking is one of the key enablers of
enterprise and cloud networking. When dealing with virtual networks, we
usually need virtual switches for creating complex network topology.
Virtual switching solutions like Software Defined Networking (SDN) has
gained lots of attention recently for its strength in managing large and
ever-changing network infrastructures. But long before SDN came into
existence, Linux bridge was the prevalent virtual switching tool, and it
still is nowadays. A bridge, just like a physical switch, is a device to
unite network segments transparently by forwarding the network traffic
from the network devices connected to it. In this lab, we will first go
through some Linux networking concepts and tools which can later help us
understand the way Linux bridge works. Then, we will look into Linux
bridge from both application and implementation perspective.

**Objectives:** Upon completing the experiments, students should:

-  Understand the basic concepts of Linux networking.
-  Get familiar with some popular Linux networking tools used to analyze
   network structure and traffic.
-  Learn to use Linux bridge tools to manage Linux bridges, and
   understand the how the Linux bridge works.

**Required Knowledge:** Students are required to have the following prerequisite knowledge for this lab:

1. The usage of the text-based terminal and basic Linux commands.
2. Knowledge of accessing a remote Linux server using SSH.
3. Basic understanding of the use of common network devices such as
   routers and switches.

.. _background:

**Background:**

   **EZSetup** is a novel Web application capable of creating a variety
   of user-defined cybersecurity practice environments (e.g., labs and
   competition scenarios) in one or more computing clouds (e.g.,
   OpenStack or Amazon AWS). EZSetup provides a Web user interface for
   practice designers to create a practice scenario by dragging and
   dropping icons visually and the links between them thus allows for
   customization and significantly reduces overhead in creating and
   using practice environments. Completely spared from the complexity of
   creating practice environments, end users can jump right in and fully
   concentrate on cybersecurity practice.

   For more information about EZSetup, please see bundled `user manual
   file`_.

   **Secure Shell (SSH)** is a network protocol that allows data to be
   exchanged over a secure channel between two computers. Encryption
   provides confidentiality and integrity of data. SSH uses public-key
   cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow the remote
   computer to authenticate the user, if necessary.

   For more information about SSH, please see
   `<https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Secure_Shell>`_.
   
   **tcpdump** is a common packet analyzer that runs under the command
   line. It allows the user to display TCP/IP and other packets being
   transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is
   attached. Distributed under the BSD license, tcpdump is free
   software.

   For more information about tcpdump, please see its manual page:
   `<https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/tcpdump.1.html>`_. For tcpdump and
   wireshark filtering syntax, please see
   `<http://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap-filter.7.html>`_.

   **Wireshark** is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used
   for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications
   protocol development, and education. Wireshark is very similar to
   tcpdump, but has a graphical front-end, plus some integrated sorting
   and filtering options.

   For more information about Wireshark, please see its User’s Manual:
   `<https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/>`_.

**Environment:**
In this lab, students can access two virtual machines (VM) from EZSetup.
The first one is for Linux bridge experiments, and the second one is for
observing the network traffic. The network topology is given by **Figure
1**, VM properties and access information are provided in **Table 1** below.
Please refer to the EZSetup dashboard for the actual public IP addresses
and passwords.

Task 1: Linux Networking Basics
-------------------------------

A computer network is a telecommunication network for connected computer
nodes exchanging data through data links. When talking about the
composition of a computer network, people usually use conceptual models
to describe the characteristics of the network and its functions.
Network models like IBM System Network Architecture (SNA), Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) model, and Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) model
make it easier for people to standardize diverse communication systems
and protocols by abstract the network into several layers.

The seven layers of an OSI model, as described in :download:`ISOIEC 7498-1 <media/LBmedia/ISOIEC7498-1.pdf>`, are listed below in **Table 2**. These layers are identified by their functions and roles in data processing, like dealing with electric signals or routing data across the network. Each layer provides necessary interfaces to its upper layer, the higher the layer, the more abstract the data representation will be.

**Table 2** Layers of OSI Model

+-------------+-------------------------------------+------------------+

A network interface is a software representation of physical or virtual
network device. On Linux systems, you can find available network
interfaces in ``/proc/net/dev``, and access device configuration and
statistics under ``/sys/class/net/`` folder. On Debian-based Linux systems
like Ubuntu and Linux Mint, you can also configure network interfaces in
``/etc/network/interfaces`` and files under ``/etc/network/interfaces.d/``
folder. If you only want a quick look at the interfaces you have, please
use the ``ifconfig`` command to list all interfaces along with their
detailed information. ::

	$ ifconfig -a
	lo         Link encap:Local Loopback
			   inet addr:127.0.0.1 Mask:255.0.0.0
			   inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
			   UP LOOPBACK RUNNING MTU:65536 Metric:1
			   RX packets:160 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
			   TX packets:160 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
			   collisions:0 txqueuelen:1
			   RX bytes:11840 (11.8 KB) TX bytes:11840 (11.8 KB)

We can see from the output that network interface names are listed in
the left column, configurations and statistics are in the right. For
each interface, ``ifconfig`` will give its device type (like Ethernet or
Local Loopback), hardware address (or MAC address), IPv4 and IPv6
addresses, a network mask of each address, running status, input/output
packet numbers and sizes.

Since the :font:`ens4` interface is down. let’s set the IP address and bring it
up following the command lines below. ::

	$ sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.10/16 dev ens4
	
	$ sudo ifconfig ens4 up

Like sending an email to someone, if we want to transmit data to a network
interface over a network, we need some addressing mechanisms. A MAC
address, or media access control address, is a unique identifier
assigned to network interfaces for data link layer (layer 2)
communications in a network segment, which consists of 48 bits or 6
octets written in hexadecimal and separated by colons. By looking up the
MAC address, network devices like switch or router can forward the data
to the right receiver interface. However, MAC addresses are typically
used only to direct data from one device to its next device and will be
replaced by the device which forwards your data. This means MAC
addresses are usually used in the local network and do not travel far.
Also, the MAC address binds to the physical network interface, so it
will be difficult for others to find you if you switch network interface
frequently.

That’s where Internet Protocol (IP) addresses come into play. An IPv4
(version 4) address is a 32-bit number, which is usually written in
human-readable notations with four 8-bit decimal numbers separated by
dots. An IPv6 (version) address is much longer, using a 128 bits number
and usually written in hexadecimal with colon separators. IP addresses
work in the network layer (layer 3) and are required most of the time if
a host wants to communicate with other hosts. IP addresses within a
segment of a network, or subnet, start with the same prefix, like
192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2, where 192.168 is the common prefix. To
define the prefix and the size of the subnet, people often use netmasks
or CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notations. For example, for a
subnet 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255, its netmask is 255.255.0.0 and
CIDR is 192.168.0.0/16. Here, the netmask defines how many bits from the
left in an IP address is the prefix, and we can do the bitwise AND
operation of the IP address on the netmask to get the subnet prefix.
CIDR is just a compact representation of the count of leading 1 bits in
the prefix.

An example of sending a packet from your personal computer to a remote
web server is shown below in **Figure 2**. During the transmission, we also
need to find the physical location (MAC address) of a machine by its IP
address, which can be achieved by using Address Resolution Protocol
(ARP). You probably see an ARP request and response when you initiate a
connection to another machine, which you haven’t connected before.

Linux provides a set of network tools for developers to test their
network setups. To view interface information, we can use the ``ip`` command
apart from the ``ifconfig`` command we talked about earlier. ::

	$ ip a
	1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN
	group default qlen 1
		link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
		inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
		valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
		inet6 ::1/128 scope host
		valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

To test the connectivity between your machine and another host, you can
use the ``ping`` command to send Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
packets. ::

	$ ping www.google.com -c 3
	PING www.google.com (74.125.30.103) 56(84) bytes of data.
	64 bytes from of-in-f103.1e100.net (74.125.30.103): icmp_seq=1 ttl=42
	time=36.4 ms
	64 bytes from of-in-f103.1e100.net (74.125.30.103): icmp_seq=2 ttl=42
	time=34.9 ms
	64 bytes from of-in-f103.1e100.net (74.125.30.103): icmp_seq=3 ttl=42
	time=34.2 ms
	
	--- www.google.com ping statistics ---
	3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2002ms
	rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 34.248/35.211/36.429/0.933 ms

Sometimes, you may want to learn more about what’s going on under the
hood, such as, what the network frames or packets are like when you
visit a website. You can use a sniffer tool to intercept and filter the
network traffic passing through your interfaces. A command-line tool
``tcpdump`` is used for the network traffic sniffing. You can assign the
interface you want to inspect, and a set of rules to match the packets.
For example, if you want to listen on interface :font:`ens3`, you can run the
following command. ::

	$ sudo tcpdump -i ens3
	tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol
	decode
	listening on ens3, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144
	bytes
	05:53:33.604965 IP 192.168.0.16.ssh > 192.168.97.6.57405: Flags [P.],
	seq 241650537:241650645, ack 3972362028, win 459, length 108
	05:53:33.605016 IP 192.168.0.16.ssh > 192.168.97.6.57405: Flags [P.],
	seq 108:144, ack 1, win 459, length 36
	05:53:33.605071 IP 192.168.0.16.ssh > 192.168.97.6.57405: Flags [P.],
	seq 144:252, ack 1, win 459, length 108
	05:53:33.605106 IP 192.168.0.16.ssh > 192.168.97.6.57405: Flags [P.],
	seq 252:288, ack 1, win 459, length 36

The ``sudo`` command above is to make sure you have enough privilege to
execute the following command. If you are only interested in a
particular set of packets, e.g., a packet to www.google.com, you can
apply some filter rules behind the ``tcpdump`` command. ::

	$ sudo tcpdump -i ens3 dst host www.google.com

.. _pcap-filter: http://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap-filter.7.html

.. note:: For a comprehensive list of filter syntax, you can refer back to the `pcap-filter`_ manage listed in the :ref:`Background<Background>` section.

If you like to work in a desktop environment, Wireshark is also a great choice. Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer which lets you live capture network traffic and provide easy-to-use offline analysis functions. First, let’s open Wireshark by typing the command below in terminal window. ::

	$ sudo wireshark-gtk

Or, you can start Wireshark by right-clicking on your VNC screen and
choose the Applications > Internet > Wireshark.

Before starting the capture, we need to tell Wireshark which interfaces
we want to listen on. Click the first button in the toolbar and check
one or more interfaces in the interface selection dialog. Then, press
the ``Start`` button to initiate the capturing process.

   **Figure 3** Interface selection dialog in Wireshark

Once the capture begins, we can see all the network traffic in the
packet list pane. There are several columns available, including the
packet source and destination IP or MAC address, the protocol used and
the packet length. Each line corresponds to one packet in the capture
file or stream. If you select a line in this pane, packet details will
be displayed in the packet detail and packet bytes panes. In the packet
detail pane, protocols used by the packet will show in an expandable
tree, with lower layer protocols to the top and higher layer protocols
to the bottom. You can click on any protocol to view its fields and
values, or raw bytes in the packet bytes pane.

Lab Exercise 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Log in to the first VM (lb-vm1) and answer the following questions.

1. What are the interfaces on your VM? What’s their MAC and IP 
   addresses? What’s their MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) value?
   
2. What are the netmask and IP range for the subnet 10.0.0.0/23?
 
3. Can you connect to the host 192.168.0.1? What about 192.168.0.9? What
   command do you use? If you cannot connect to a host, what does the
   reply say?
   
4. Before we move on, clear **all** of your browser history by opening the Application Menu in Firefox > History > Clear Recent History... > Set time range to clear: Everything, and check all boxes. Close your browser when this is completed. Now, open Wireshark and start capture on the :font:`ens3` interface. Then visit http://ualr.edu. How do you filter out all the HTTP request to ualr.edu? What is the IP address of the Web server? What is the “Accept-Encoding” field in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol in the first HTTP request?

  .. admonition:: Hint

	Use ``http.host`` as the display filter.

Task 2: Managing Linux Bridge
-----------------------------

Bridging is “plugging” one or more network interfaces into another
network interface which has the connectivity to a larger network. Just
imagine the dorm room in your college only has a limited number of
ethernet jacks and no router, so you and your roommate can bridge your
computers to a single ethernet port to join the Internet. The job of the
bridge is to examine the data packet destination and decide where should
it be passed to, or whether it should drop the packet, by looking at the
MAC address of plugged network interfaces.

Linux bridge is a software bridge which emulates the behavior of a
hardware bridge and provides additional powerful features like
firewalling. You can check if your system has the bridge kernel module
by the following command. ::

	$ modinfo bridge
	filename: /lib/modules/4.4.0-97-generic/kernel/net/bridge/bridge.ko
	alias: rtnl-link-bridge
	version: 2.3
	license: GPL
	srcversion: E093FB4EB1EE49C1B0F6A2F
	depends: stp,llc
	intree: Y
	vermagic: 4.4.0-97-generic SMP mod_unload modversions

If it shows no errors, you can manage bridges either using the ``brctl``
command in the bridge-utilities package or the ip command. We will be
using ``brctl`` in the rest of the instructions.

First, let’s see all subcommands ``brctl`` offers. ::

	$ brctl
	Usage: brctl [commands]
	commands:
		addbr <bridge> add bridge
		delbr <bridge> delete bridge
		addif <bridge> <device> add interface to bridge
		delif <bridge> <device> delete interface from bridge
		hairpin <bridge> <port> {on|off} turn hairpin on/off
		setageing <bridge> <time> set ageing time
		setbridgeprio <bridge> <prio> set bridge priority
		setfd <bridge> <time> set bridge forward delay
		sethello <bridge> <time> set hello time
		setmaxage <bridge> <time> set max message age
		setpathcost <bridge> <port> <cost> set path cost
		setportprio <bridge> <port> <prio> set port priority
		show [ <bridge> ] show a list of bridges
		showmacs <bridge> show a list of mac addrs
		showstp <bridge> show bridge stp info
		stp <bridge> {on|off} turn stp on/off

To create a bridge, you can use the ``addbr`` subcommand followed by the
bridge name. ::

	$ sudo brctl addbr br0

The above command will add a bridge named :font:`br0`. The bridge will show as a
network interface, and you can check it by command ``ifconfig br0``, or you
can show all the bridges using ::

	$ brctl show
	bridge name    bridge id            STP enabled    interfaces
	br0            8000.000000000000    no


Deleting a bridge is just as simple as creating a bridge. You can use
``brctl delbr`` with the bridge name ::

	$ sudo brctl delbr br0

Now, let’s try to plug an interface to the bridge. 

.. warning:: Please be careful with the interface name when you enter the command. Adding an interface to a bridge will make the interface lose network connection temporarily, and the first ethernet interface, which is :font:`ens3`, is the channel for the VM to communicate with you. So, make sure you don’t operate on the :font:`ens3` interface, or you will lose the connection to your VM. 

Enter the following command to add the second ethernet interface :font:`ens4` to bridge :font:`br0`. ::

	$ sudo brctl addif br0 ens4

You can check the bridge details once again using ``brctl show``. Also, if
you want to remove an interface from a bridge, you can run the following
command. ::

	$ sudo brctl delif br0 ens4

After you add the interface to the bridge, we may test the interface
connectivity to its subnet by pinging the other VM (lb-vm2). ::

	$ ping -I ens4 10.0.0.1 -c 3
	PING 10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1) from 10.0.0.10 ens4: 56(84) bytes of data.
	From 10.0.0.10 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
	From 10.0.0.10 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable
	From 10.0.0.10 icmp_seq=3 Destination Host Unreachable
	--- 10.0.0.1 ping statistics ---
	3 packets transmitted, 0 received, +3 errors, 100% packet loss, time
	2014ms
	pipe 3

Right now, you should receive ``Destination Host Unreachable`` error,
which means :font:`ens4` cannot send or receive packets from other hosts on the
same subnet. This can be explained with the first two figures in **Figure
5**.

   **Figure 5** Steps of connecting a virtual host to the Linux bridge

At first, the system connects to the subnet via :font:`ens4` directly. When we
add :font:`ens4` to the bridge, we cut down the connection between the system
and :font:`ens4`, and right now the system still tries to send packets to :font:`ens4`
instead of :font:`br0`. To re-establish the connection, we should tell the
system to send all traffic within the subnet to :font:`br0`. To do this, we need
to move the IP address of :font:`ens4` to :font:`br0` and bring up the bridge interface. ::

	$ sudo ip addr del 10.0.0.10/16 dev ens4

	$ sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.10/16 dev br0

	$ sudo ip link set br0 up

Now, you should be able to ping other hosts in the subnet. Let’s try to
add some more interfaces to the bridge and see if it works. Move to the
``~/labs/linux_bridge`` directory and run the following command to add two
virtual hosts :font:`h1` and :font:`h2` to your VM. ::

	$ ./start.sh
	
	=======================================

	Virtual Hosts Activated!

	Type exit to quit.

	=======================================

You can use ``<host name> <command>`` to execute network-related commands
as if they are executed in another machine. No sudo is need here. For
example, you can list interfaces of :font:`h1` using ::

	$ h1 ifconfig -a

Or ping another host using ::

	$ h2 ping 10.0.0.12 -c 3

Note here, however, that you should still receive ``Destination Host
Unreachable`` because although running ``./start.sh`` has added :font:`h1` and :font:`h2` to
the VM, we still need to connect them to the subnet.

Also, you can still execute commands in the host VM by simply typing
commands without host name.

If you list interfaces on the host VM, you will find there are two new
interfaces added, which are :font:`p-h1` and :font:`p-h2`. Each of the :font:`p-\*` interfaces are one end of a tunnel which connects the virtual host and the VM. Packets from the virtual hosts can reach the VM through this tunnel, and vice versa. **Figure 6** depicts current network topology.

Now, to connect :font:`h1` and :font:`h2` to the subnet, we need to add the VM side :font:`p-h1` and :font:`p-h2` to the bridge. This should be done in the Virtual Host application. ::

	$ sudo brctl addif br0 p-h1

	$ sudo brctl addif br0 p-h2

This will connect :font:`p-h1` and :font:`p-h2` to the bridge :font:`br0`, and also make it possible for virtual host :font:`h1` to communicate with other hosts in the subnet. Now you should be able to ping other hosts using the command listed above.

Remember to use the ``exit`` command once you are done with tinkering the
virtual hosts.

Lab Exercise 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Activate virtual hosts using the ``start.sh`` script and try to connect both
hosts to the network. Then answer the following questions.

1. What’s the MAC address of the bridge interface?

2. What commands do you use to connect the virtual hosts to the 
   network? What are the IP and MAC addresses of the virtual hosts?

3. Open Wireshark on the second VM (lb-vm2) and listen on the :font:`ens3`
   interface. Then, try to ping it from virtual host :font:`h1`. What’s the
   IP and MAC address of the incoming packets do you see in
   Wireshark? What does this mean?

4. On the first VM (lb-vm1), use tcpdump to capture traffic on :font:`ens4`.
   Then, try to ping the second VM (lb-vm2) and :font:`h2` from :font:`h1`
   successively. What commands do you use? What do you observe and
   what does it mean?
