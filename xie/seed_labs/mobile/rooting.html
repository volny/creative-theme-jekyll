<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Android devices do not allow their owners to have the root privilege on
the device. This is fine for normal customers, but for users who want to
make deep customizations on their devices, this is too restrictive.
There are ways to overcome these restrictions, most of which require the
root privilege on the device. The process of gaining the root device on
Android devices is called <em>rooting</em>. Being able to root Android devices
is a very useful skill for security experts.</p>
<p>The objective of this lab is two-fold. First, through this lab, students
will get familiar with the process of device rooting and understand why
certain steps are needed. Many people can root Android devices, but not
many people fully understand why things have to be done in a particular
way. Second, the entire rooting mechanism involves many pieces of
knowledge about the Android system and operating system in general, so
it serves as a great vehicle for students to gain such in-depth system
knowledge. In this lab, we will ask students to develop a complete
rooting package from scratch, and demonstrate how to use the package to
root the Android VM provided by us.</p>

<div class="section" id="background-knowledge-about-rooting">
<h3>Background Knowledge about Rooting<a class="headerlink" href="#background-knowledge-about-rooting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of rooting an Android device is to gain the root privilege
inside the Android OS. There are many reasons why people want to do
that. For example, Android devices often come with many pre-installed
system apps that are useless most of the time, but they take storage
space, RAM, system resources, and drain device battery. These useless
apps are generally known as bloatware; they are installed in protected
places, and only the root user (or other privileged user) can remove
them. Although the device is owned by a user, the user is not allowed to
run code using the root privilege. Users can only get the root privilege
if the device is rooted. In general, rooting allows users to customize
their phones, removing restrictions, adding new features, and making
changes to the system. There are several approaches to root an Android
device, and we will discuss them in more details in this lab.
<strong>Figure&nbsp;1</strong> provides a summary of these
approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="modifying-android-from-inside">
<h3>Modifying Android from inside.<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-android-from-inside" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first rooting approach is doing it from inside Android. For an
un-rooted device, everything that the user runs is running with a normal
user ID (not root). Therefore, rooting from inside Android means that
the user has to gain the root privilege as a normal user. Obviously,
this is impossible for a perfectly implemented operating system.
However, the chances are that Android may not be perfectly implemented,
so there might exist vulnerabilities in the system. If these
vulnerabilities are inside the kernel or daemons running with the root
privilege, users can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain the root
privilege. This is one of the techniques to root Android devices.</p>
<p>In the past, there were many rooting exploits, such as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RageAgainstTheCage</span></code>, which took advantage of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RLIMIT_NPROC</span></code> max,
the value specifying how many processes a given UID can run. This
exploit first uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;adb</span> <span class="pre">shell&quot;</span></code> to run a shell on the device via the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">adb</span></code> daemon. The UID of the shell will be 2000. The exploit then
forks new processes until the number of processes have reached the limit
and the fork call will fail. At this point, the exploit kills the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">adbd</span></code> daemon, and then reconnect to it using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;adb</span> <span class="pre">shell&quot;</span></code>. This
causes the system to restart the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">adb</span></code> daemon. When <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">adb</span></code> is
started, it always has the root privilege, but it will drop the
privilege to UID 2000 using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setuid(2000)</span></code>. Unfortunately, the UID
2000 has already used up its process quota, so the call will fail.
Unfortunately, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">adb</span></code> daemon fails to handle the failure correctly:
instead of exiting, it keeps running, while retaining the root
privilege. As results, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;adb</span> <span class="pre">shell&quot;</span></code> command will give users a
root shell. This vulnerability has already been fixed after Android 2.2.</p>

<div class="section" id="modifying-android-from-outside">
<h3>Modifying Android from outside.<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-android-from-outside" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since Android’s access control prevents a normal user from modifying the
part of the system that is only modifiable by the root, doing it inside
Android is going to subject to the access control. However, if we can do
it from outside, we are not subject to Android’s access control any
more. This leads to the second approach, which is to directly modify
Android’s system files from outside.</p>
<p>Assume that another operating system is installed on your Android
device. This means that the device has a dual-boot configuration,
allowing you to boot into any of these two operating systems when the
device powers on. If we boot into this second operating system, and
become the root for this OS, we can mount the partition used by the
Android system. Once this partition is mounted, we can access all the
files stored inside the partition. Because Android is not running, its
access control has no use. Therefore, we can make arbitrary changes to
its files. For example, we can place some programs in the system, and
modify Android’s initialization scripts, and ask Android to run our
programs as a root during its initialization process.</p>
<p>The good news is that most Android devices do have the second operating
system installed, and it is called <em>recovery OS</em>. As the name indicates,
it is meant for recovery purposes, but it is mostly used for updating
operating system. The bad news is that this operating system also has
access controls, preventing users from running arbitrary programs or
commands. Recovery OS is typically placed on devices by vendors, who use
the OS to update Android, but not wanting users to make arbitrary
updates. To enforce that, recovery OSes do not give users a shell
prompt, preventing users from running arbitrary commands. Instead, they
take a package provided from outside (either from users or downloaded
from the Internet); the package contains the commands and files needed
for updating the Android OS. This mechanism is widely used for OS
update, and it is called Over-The-Air (OTA) update. The package is
called OTA package, which has a standard file structure that we will
talk about later.</p>
<p>Most recovery OSes only accept the packages made by the vendors to
ensure that any update to the Android OS is approved by the vendors.
This is enforced using digital signatures, i.e., the package needs to be
signed by vendors, or it will not be accepted by the recovery OS. This
protection becomes a roadblock for rooting, because the package that we
use for rooting purposes will not come from the vendor of the device. We
need to find ways to bypass this access control.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reinstall-recovery-os">
<h3>Reinstall recovery OS.<a class="headerlink" href="#reinstall-recovery-os" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Instead of bypassing the access controls of the recovery OS, the easiest
way is to replace the entire stock recovery OS with another recovery OS
that does not have such access controls. This new recovery OS, called
custom recovery OS, will not include the signature verification part, so
we can provide any OTA packages to the recovery OS. This will allow us
to make arbitrary changes to the Android partition.</p>
<p>Here is another bad news. There is another access control that prevents
us from replacing the stock recovery OS, and this time it is the
bootloader. Bootloader is a low level code that loads an operating
system or some other system software for the computer after the computer
is powered on. When a bootloader is “locked”, it will simply load one of
the OSes that is already installed on the device, leaving no chances for
users to modify any of the pre-installed OSes. If a bootloader can be
unlocked, it will add another option, which allows users to install
custom operating systems on the device, as well as replacing the
existing ones. The process is often referred to as flashing custom OS.</p>
<p>Manufacturers usually make their bootloaders locked out of the box
because they want to be in control of what software is running the
device. However, most manufacturers do provide ways for users to unlock
the bootloader on their devices, provided that by doing so users will
lose all of their data, as well as the warranties.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="background-knowledge-about-ota">
<h3>Background Knowledge about OTA<a class="headerlink" href="#background-knowledge-about-ota" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>OTA is a standard technique for devices to update Android operating
systems. Since rooting also needs to update Android OS, OTA becomes a
popular choice. In this section, we will describe the structure of the
OTA package. Students need to build their own OTA package from the
scratch in this lab.</p>
<div class="align-center figure" id="id4">
<img alt="OTA Structure" src="../../_images/Real_OTA.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 2: OTA Structure</span></p>
</div>
<p>OTA package is just a zip file and its structure is depicted in
<strong>Figure 2</strong>. Of particular interest to this lab
is the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">META-INF</span></code> folder, which includes signature and certificates of
the package along with two very important files named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update-binary</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">updater-script</span></code>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">META-INF/com/google/android/update-binary</span></code>: This binary is
executed by the recovery OS to apply OTA updates; it loads and
execute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">updater-script</span></code>.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">META-INF/com/google/android/updater-script</span></code>: This is an
installation script which is interpreted by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update-binary</span></code>. It is
written using a script language called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Edify</span></code>, which describes the
required action to be performed to apply updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>After signature verification on the OTA package, the recovery OS
extracts the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update-binary</span></code> executable from the OTA package to the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp</span></code> directory and runs it by passing three arguments as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>update-binary version output package
where, version is the version of recovery API,
       output is the command pipe that update-binary uses to  communicate
                          with recovery,
       package is the path of the OTA package,


An Example would be:  update-binary 3 stdout /sdcard/ota.zip
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>On a successful execution of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">updater-script</span></code>, the recovery OS copies
the execution logs to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/cache/recovery/</span></code> directory and reboots
into the Android OS. Execution logs can be accessible from the Android
OS after rebooting. This is how android system is updated by using OTA
package.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lab-environment">
<h2>Lab Environment<a class="headerlink" href="#lab-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this lab, we assume that the bootloader on the device can be
unlocked, and the stock recovery OS can be replaced. Replacing the
recovery OS in the VM environment is quite difficult, and it is not
within the scope of this lab. The Android VM that you download from our
web site already has a custom recovery OS installed. Actually, we simply
use Ubuntu 16.04 as the “recovery OS”. Technically, this is not a
recovery OS; it is just another OS installed on the device. We use this
general-purpose OS to emulate what users can do using a custom recovery
OS. Once users boot into this OS, they can run any arbitrary commands
(as root), and be able to make arbitrary changes to the Android
partition.</p>
<p>Students who have a physical Android device and want to know how to root
a real device, they can follow our guidelines in
Section&nbsp;7 However, other than the step to
replace the recovery OS, everything else is the same as what we do in
this lab.</p>
<p>Another important thing to know is that our Android VM is already
rooted. That was done when we built the VM from the Android source code.
Our VM build is actually a <em>userdebug</em> build, and several doors were
built into the VM to allow root access. We choose this build because
several of our other labs require the root access. Real Android devices
use <em>user</em> build, which do not have these doors for root access. Details
about these doors can be found in our VM manual. In this lab, students
are not allowed to use those doors to gain the root access; they have to
use the OTA mechanism to achieve that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="task-1-build-a-simple-ota-package">
<h2>Task 1: Build a simple OTA package<a class="headerlink" href="#task-1-build-a-simple-ota-package" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this lab, students will build a simple OTA package from scratch, and
use it to root Android OS. We divide this complicated task into several
tasks, each focusing on a specific goal. Here are the goals that we
would like to achieve:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How to inject a program into the Android OS from the recovery OS?</li>
<li>How to get our injected program to run automatically, and with the
root privilege?</li>
<li>How to write a program that can give us the root shell?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this Task 1, we focus on how to inject a program into the Android OS
from the recovery OS, and then get Android to run our injected program
using the root privilege. At this point, we are not focusing on the
actual thing that we can do in this program, as long as it is something
that requires the root privilege. For the sake of simplicity, let us
simply create a dummy file in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/system</span></code> folder of Android, which
requires the root privilege (the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/system</span></code> folder is not writable by
normal users). The following command puts a word “hello” in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/system/dummy</span></code> (we put this command in a shell script file called
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dummy.sh</span></code>):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo hello &gt; /system/dummy
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-1-write-the-update-script">
<h3>Step 1: Write the update script.<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-write-the-update-script" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update-binary</span></code> file in the OTA package is the executable file
that will be first executed by the recovery OS. This is where we get the
OS update started. This file can be a binary executable, or just a
simple script file. For the latter case, the recovery OS should already
have the binary executable (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bash</span></code>) to execute the script file.
In this task, we will simply use a shell script, as our recover OS
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ubuntu</span></code>) does have <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bash</span></code> installed.</p>
<p>Our purpose for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update-binary</span></code> is two-fold: (1) inject our
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dummy.sh</span></code> program into the Android OS, and (2) change the Android OS
configuration file, so our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dummy.sh</span></code> can be automatically executed
with the root privilege when Android boots up. For the first task,
students need to figure out where to place <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dummy.sh</span></code>, and how to set
up its permissions. It should be noted that the file has to be placed
into the Android partition, which is already mounted to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/android</span></code>
directory in the recovery OS.</p>
<p>For the second purpose, we need to get <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dummy.sh</span></code> to run automatically
when Android boots up, and we need to make sure that it runs with the
root privilege. There are many ways to achieve this. In this task, we
use one approach related to Linux, and in the next task, we will use a
different approach related to Android framework.</p>
<p>Android is built on top of the Linux operating system. When it boots up,
its underlying Linux boots up first, which conducts system
initialization, including starting essential daemon processes. The
booting procedure, using the root privilege, runs a file called
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/system/etc/init.sh</span></code>&nbsp; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> for part of the initialization. Therefore,
if we can insert a command into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.sh</span></code> file, we can run our
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dummy.sh</span></code> file with the root privilege.</p>
<p>If we can do it manually, we can simply edit the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.sh</span></code>, and add a
new command in it, but we are writing an OTA package, so the actions to
modify the file need to be coded in our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update-binary</span></code> file. There
are many ways to code that, and we will use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sed</span></code> command, which
is stream editor for filtering and transforming text. Our idea is to
find where the statement <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;return</span> <span class="pre">0&quot;</span></code> is inside <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.sh</span></code>, and
insert a command before that, essentially placing the command before the
program in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.sh</span></code> finishes.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sed -i &quot;/return 0/i /system/xbin/dummy.sh&quot; /android/system/etc/init.sh

Explanation:
  -  &quot;-i&quot;: edit files in place.
  -  &quot;/return 0/&quot;: match the line that has the content &quot;return 0&quot;.

<h3>Step 2: Build the OTA Package.<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-build-the-ota-package" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Constructing an OTA package is quite straightforward. All we need to do
is to put our files in their corresponding folders according to
<strong>Figure&nbsp;2</strong>. We need to maintain the same
structure as what is shown in the figure, but you do not need to create
all the files that are not needed for our task&nbsp;(such as signature and
optional files). You can put the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dummy.sh</span></code> file in any place of your
OTA package, as long as the location matches with your command in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update-binary</span></code>. After creating the file structure, we can use the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zip</span></code> command to create a zip file:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>zip -r my_ota.zip ./
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You should include the file structure of your OTA package in your
report. You can run the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;unzip</span> <span class="pre">-l&quot;</span></code> command to do that.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Run the OTA Package<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-run-the-ota-package" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After building the OTA package, we can provide it to the recovery OS,
which will run it automatically. However, that is how it works with a
real recovery OS. In our lab environment, we are using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ubuntu</span></code> as our
recovery OS, but it does not have the needed recovery functionality.
Therefore, we have to emulate the recovery functionality. This means, we
have to manually unpack the OTA package (using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unzip</span></code> command),
go to the folder <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">META-INF/com/google/android</span></code> folder to find the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update-binary</span></code> file, and run it. If you have written everything
correctly, your Android is now updated. Now, boot up your Android OS,
and see whether the dummy file is created inside <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/system</span></code>. In your

<p>In the previous task, we modify the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.sh</span></code> file to get our injected
program to run automatically, and with the root privilege. This
initialization script file is used by the underlying Linux operating
system. Once the Linux part is initialized, Android OS will bootstrap
its runtime that is built on top of Linux. We would like to execute our
injected program during this bootstrapping process. The objective of
this task is not only to find a different way to do what we have done in
the previous task, but also to learn how Android gets bootstrapped.</p>
<p>Before conducting this task, please read the guideline in
Section&nbsp;7.1 about the Android booting
sequence. From the guideline, we can see that when the Android runtime
bootstraps, it always run a program called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process</span></code>, using the
root privilege. This starts the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Zygote</span></code> daemon, whose mission is to
launch applications. This means that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Zygote</span></code> is the parent of all app
processes. Our goal is to modify <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process</span></code>, so in addition to
launch the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Zygote</span></code> daemon, it also runs something of our choice.
Similar to the previous task, we want to put a dummy file (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dummy2</span></code>)
in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/system</span></code> folder to demonstrate that we can run our program
with the root privilege.</p>
<p>The following sample code is a wrapper for the original <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process</span></code>.
We will rename the original <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process</span></code> binary to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process_original</span></code>, and call our wrapper program <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process</span></code>.
In our wrapper, we first write something to the dummy file, and then
invoke the original <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process</span></code> program.</p>

<div class="section" id="step-1-compile-the-code">
<h3>Step 1. Compile the code.<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-compile-the-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We need to compile the above code in our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SEEDUbuntu</span></code> VM, not inside
the recovery OS or Android OS, as neither of them has the native code
development environment installed; we have installed the Native
Development Kit (NDK) in our SEEDUbuntu VM. NDK is a set of tools that
allow us to compile C and C++ code for Android OS. This type of code,
called native code, can either be a stand-alone native program, or
invoked by Java code in Android apps via JNI (Java Native Interface).
Our wrapper <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process</span></code> program is a standalone native program,
which needs to be compiled using NDK. For more detailed instructions
about NDK, please refer to the instructional manual linked in the web
page.</p>
<p>To use NDK, we need to create two files, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Application.mk</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Android.mk</span></code>, and place them in the same folder as your source code.
The contents of these two files are described in the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The Application.mk file

APP_ABI := x86

<p>We run the following commands inside the source folder to compile our

<p>Just like the previous task, we need to write <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update-binary</span></code> to tell

in this task. Here are some guidelines:</p>
<ul class="simple">

depending on the architecture of the device. Our Android VM is a
64-bit device, so the name should be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process64</span></code>.</li>
</ul>

describe their observations and explanation.</p>

<div class="section" id="task-3-implement-simplesu-for-getting-root-shell">
<h2>Task 3: Implement <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SimpleSU</span></code> for Getting Root Shell<a class="headerlink" href="#task-3-implement-simplesu-for-getting-root-shell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now we know how to inject our code into the Android system and gain the
root privilege, but we have not completely achieved our ultimate goal
yet. An important reason for users to root their Android devices is to
execute any command of their choice using the root privilege. When
building the OTA package, the commands are already decided; if users
want to run other commands after the programs in the OTA package is
executed, they will not be able to do that, unless they can get a shell
that runs with the root privilege. Such a shell is called <em>root shell</em>.</p>
<p>We can launch the root shell using the methods from the previous tasks,
but that is problematic: shell programs are interactive, meaning they
will not terminate unless users type an exit command; this will stop the
system booting process, so the OS will never be able to complete its
booting sequence. The interesting question is how to run something
non-interactive during the booting process that enables us to get an
interactive root shell later on.</p>
<p>If we were on a typical Linux system, we can easily solve the above
problem by using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chmod</span></code> command to turn on the Set-UID bit of any
shell program (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bash</span></code>) that is owned by the root. Later on, when
any user runs this shell program, the shell will run with the owner’s
(i.e. root) privilege. Unfortunately, for security reasons, Android has
removed the Set-UID mechanism from its underlying Linux OS since version
4.3 (API Level 18). The official document of security updates on Android
4.3 says the following:“No setuid/setgid programs. Added support for
filesystem capabilities to Android system files and removed all
setuid/setguid programs. This reduces root attack surface and the
likelihood of potential security vulnerabilities.”</p>
<p>Another approach is to start a root daemon during the booting process,
and then use this daemon to help users get a root shell. This is the
approach used by some of the popular rooting OTA packages, such as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SuperSU</span></code> developed by Chainfire. In this task, students will write
such a daemon and use it to understand how it helps users to get a root
shell. The main idea of this approach is quite simple. When users want
to get a root shell, they run a client program, which sends a request to
the root daemon. Upon receiving the request, the daemon starts a shell
process, and “give” it to the client, i.e., allowing users to control
the shell process. The tricky part is how to let the user control the
shell process that is created by the daemon.</p>
<p>For users to control the daemon-generated shell process, they need to be
able to control the standard input and output devices of the shell
process. Unfortunately, when the shell process is created, it inherits
its standard input and output devices from its parent process, which is
owned by root, so they are not controllable by the user’s client
program. We can find a way to let the client program control these
devices, or we can do it in a different way by giving the client
program’s input and output devices to the shell process, so they also
become the input/output devices for the shell process. This way, the
user has a complete control of the shell process: whatever the user
types in the input device of the client program will also be fed into
the shell process; whatever the shell process prints to its output
device will be showing to client program.</p>
<p>Writing the code to implement the above idea is not easy, as we need to
have two essential pieces of knowledge: (1)&nbsp;how to send the standard
input/output devices (file descriptors) to another process, and (2)&nbsp;once
a process receives the file descriptors, how it can use them as its
input/output devices. We provide some background knowledge regarding
these.</p>
<div class="section" id="file-descriptors">
<h3>File descriptors.<a class="headerlink" href="#file-descriptors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each process in Linux systems typically has three associated I/O
devices: standard input device (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">STDIN</span></code>), standard output device
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">STDOUT</span></code>), and standard error device (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">STDERR</span></code>). These devices are
where the process gets its user input and prints out results and error
messages. Processes access these devices through the standard POSIX
application programming interface that uses file descriptors. Basically,
I/O devices are treated just like they are files. The file descriptors
for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">STDIN</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">STDOUT</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">STDERR</span></code> are 0, 1, and 2, respectively.
In this task, we need to pass file descriptors from one process to
another.</p>
<p>File descriptors can be passed to another process either via inheritance
or explicit sending. When a parent creates a child process using
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fork()</span></code>, all the parent’s file descriptors are automatically
inherited by the child process. Beyond this stage, if the parent wants
to share a new file descriptor with its children, or if two unrelated
processes want to share the same file descriptor, they have to
explicitly send the file descriptor, which can be achieved using the
Unix Domain Socket. In our code, our client program sends its file
descriptors to the root shell process created by the daemon.</p>
<p>File descriptors can be redirected. The system call
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dup2(int</span> <span class="pre">dest,</span> <span class="pre">int</span> <span class="pre">src)</span></code> can redirect the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src</span></code> file descriptor to
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dest</span></code> one, so the file descriptor entry at index <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src</span></code> actually
points to the entry at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dest</span></code>. Therefore, whenever the process uses
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src</span></code> file descriptor, it actually uses the entry stored in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dest</span></code> entry. For example, assume that we open a file, and get a file
descriptor 5. If we call <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dup2(5,</span> <span class="pre">1)</span></code>, we basically let the file
descriptor 1 points to 5, causing anything printed out by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf()</span></code>
to be saved to the file that was just opened. This is because
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">printf()</span></code> by default prints out everything to the standard output
device, which is represented by the file descriptor 1.</p>
<div class="align-center figure" id="id5">
<img alt="File Descriptor Tables" src="../../_images/file_descriptor.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 3: File Descriptor Tables</span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Figure&nbsp;3</strong> shows the file descriptor tables of
two processes. The table of Process 0 is quite simple. It has three
standard I/O FDs (indices 0, 1, 2), a file descriptor (index 3) for an
opened file, and another file descriptor (index 4) for a socket. Table 1
is a little bit more complicated. It opened a device named
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/dev/null</span></code>, and received a file descriptor from Table 0, and store
the descriptor at index 4. Moreover, Process 1’s standard output and
error are redirected to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/dev/null</span></code>, while its standard input is
redirected to the one (index 4) received from Process 0. The consequence
of such redirections is that Process 1 will take exactly the same input
as Process 0, but all outputs are abandoned&nbsp;(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/dev/null</span></code> is a standard
device that functions like a black hole: nothing written to it gets
out).</p>

<div class="section" id="creating-new-process">
<h3>Creating new process.<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-new-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In Unix systems, we use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fork()</span></code> system call to create a new
process. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fork()</span></code> call returns an integer: for the child process,
the return value is 0, while for the parent process, the return value is
the actual process id (which is non-zero) of the newly created child
process. The child process inherits the parent’s data and execution
status, as well as the file descriptors. A sample code is provided in
the following:</p>

<h3>Passing the File Descriptors.<a class="headerlink" href="#passing-the-file-descriptors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Figure&nbsp;4</strong> shows how to use the
three standard I/O file descriptors to help the client gain the full
control of the root shell created by the server. Initially, as shown in
<strong>Figure&nbsp;4</strong> (a), the client and
server are running in different processes, while the client has a normal
privilege and the server has the root privilege. Each of them has its
own standard I/O FDs 0, 1, 2. In the figure, the client FDs are denoted
as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C_IN</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C_OUT</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C_ERR</span></code>, and the server’s FDs are denoted

<strong>Figure&nbsp;4</strong> (b), we depict how the
client and the server work together to help the client get the root
privilege.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The client connects to the server using the Unix Domain Socket.</li>
<li>Upon receiving the request, the server forks a child process and runs
a root shell. The child process inherits all the standard I/O FDs
from the parent.</li>
<li>The client sends its FDs 0, 1, and 2 to the server’s child process
using the Unix Domain Socket. These FDs will be saved in the table
indices 4, 5, and 6, respectively.</li>
<li>The child process redirects its FDs 0, 1, 2 to the FDs received from
the client, resulting in FDs 4, 5, and 6 being used the as the
standard input, output, and error devices. Since these three devices
are the same as those in the client, essentially, the client process
and the server’s child process now share the same I/O devices
(Figure&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="#fig:rooting:dispatchingControl">4</a>(c)). Although the
client process is still running with a normal user privilege, it has
the full control of the server’s child process, which is running with
the root privilege.</li>

system, detects hardware, then executes script file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.rc</span></code> to
configure the system. The script <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.rc</span></code> itself mainly focuses on
mounting files inside virtual file system and initializes system
daemons. However, it imports some other <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rc</span></code> script files for various
purposes, such as setting up environment variables, executing
architecture specific commands, and launching <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zygote</span></code>. Here are the
files imported to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.rc</span></code>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.environ.rc</span></code>: Environment variables are set by
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.environ.rc</span></code>, which provides some important path-related
environment variables. These paths are very important for launching
further processes because many of them will try to access these paths
using the corresponding environment variable names. In one of the lab
tasks, we need to pass environment variables to the child process;
now we see why that is needed.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.${ro.hardware}.rc</span></code>: Some commands or codes are architecture
specific. The variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">${ro.hardware}</span></code> is inherited from the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Init</span></code> process and passed to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.rc</span></code> script. On our
Android-x86 VM, it will be “android_x86” and the script file
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.android_x86.rc</span></code> file will be invoked. Inside this file,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.sh</span></code> is called. This <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.sh</span></code> file is the one used in In
Task 1, where we inject the invocation of our code.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.${ro.zygote}.rc</span></code>: This file starts a very important daemon
called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Zygote</span></code>. The variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">${ro.zygote}</span></code> is inherited from
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Init</span></code> binary. It can be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zygote32</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zygote64</span></code>, for
32-bit and 64-bit architecture, respectively; it can also be
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zygote32_64</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zygote64_32</span></code> for hybrid modes
(mainMode_secondaryMode). In our Android-x86 VM, it is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.zygote32.rc</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rc</span></code> script files are stored in an image file, named
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ramdisk.img</span></code> on our Android-x86 VM; on real devices, these script
files are inside <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">boot.img</span></code>, which contains <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ramdisk.img</span></code> and the
kernel. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ramdisk.img</span></code> file will be extracted into the memory while
booting up. Making modifications directly on an image file is not very
easy. That is the main reason why we only change the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.sh</span></code> file in
our first task, because the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.sh</span></code> file is inside the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/system</span></code>
folder, not inside those image files.</p>

<h3>Phase III: The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Zygote</span></code> Process.<a class="headerlink" href="#phase-iii-the-zygote-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init.${ro.zygote}.rc</span></code> file, a special daemon is launched by
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Init</span></code> process via the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;service</span> <span class="pre">zygote</span> <span class="pre">/system/bin/app_process</span> <span class="pre">...&quot;</span></code> command (options are
omitted). The command starts a daemon called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zygote</span></code>, which executes
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process</span></code> binary. Zygote is the starting point of the Android
runtime. It starts the runtime environment of Dalvik or ART, which are
virtual machines that run Java programs. In Android, system servers and
most applications are written in Java, so <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Zygote</span></code> is an essential
daemon, and it runs with the root privilege.</p>
<p>That makes <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process</span></code> another place to insert our rooting code. The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process</span></code> file is not a real binary file; it is a symbolic link,
pointing to either <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process32</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process64</span></code>, depending on
the architecture of the system. Therefore, we just need to change the
symbolic link, and let it point to our code. In our code, we will have
two processes, one running our rooting code, and the other running the
original <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">app_process</span></code> code. This approach is commonly used by many
existing rooting OTA packages.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-to-unlock-the-boot-loader-on-a-real-device">
<h4>How to unlock the boot loader on a real device<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-unlock-the-boot-loader-on-a-real-device" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As what is shown in <strong>Figure&nbsp;5</strong>, when the
power button is pressed, the device firsts goes to a fixed location in
its ROM, and run instructions from there. These instructions will then
go to a pre-defined location on the disk or flash drive to load the
bootloader, and pass the control to it. Bootloader then loads the
operating system, and eventually gives the control to the loaded OS.</p>
<p>Most of the Android devices come with two operating systems, an Android
OS and a recovery OS. By default, the bootloader will choose the Android
OS to boot; however, if some special key combination is pressed during
the booting, the bootloader will boot the recover OS instead. On Nexus
devices, this is achieved by pressing the “Volume Down” and “Power”
buttons together.</p>
<p>Bootloader usually have another functionality that is often disabled by
default. This functionality allows users to replace (often called
<em>flash</em>) the OS images on any of the partitions, so users can install a
different recovery OS or Android OS. Most manufacturers do not want
users to make such kind of modifications to their devices, so before
shipping devices to customers, they disable the functionality, and hence
we say that “the bootloader is locked”. With a locked bootloader, any
attempt to flash the installed OS will be denied by the bootloader. The
following command tries to flash the recovery OS with a locked
bootloader; as we can see, we get an error message:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># fastboot flash recovery CustomRecoveryOS.img
sending &#39;recovery&#39; (11600 KB) ...
OKAY [ 0.483s]
writing &#39;recovery&#39; ...
FAILED (remote: not supported in locked device)
finished. total time: 0.585s
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Some vendors choose to permanently lock the bootloader; in this case, it
will be very hard to flash the OSes on the devices. However, many
vendors choose not to do so, and instead, they provide instructions to
unlock the bootloader, so users who really want to flash their devices
can still do that. We will show how to unlock the bootloader. For the
demonstration purpose we are using a Nexus device. To unlock it, first
we need to load bootloader of the Nexus device by passing the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;adb</span> <span class="pre">reboot</span> <span class="pre">bootloader&quot;</span></code> command or by interrupting the normal boot
process using the “volume down” and “power” button combination.
<strong>Figure&nbsp;6</strong> (a) shows the bootloader screen
of a Nexus 5 device, which indicates that the bootloader is locked.</p>
<div class="align-center figure" id="id8">
<img alt="Unlock Bootloader" src="../../_images/Bootloader.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 6: Unlock Bootloader</span></p>
</div>
<p>Bootloader of Nexus devices can be unlocked by using the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;fastboot</span> <span class="pre">oem</span> <span class="pre">unlock&quot;</span></code> command. Be very careful while unlocking the
bootloader because it will void the manufacturer’s warranty and
completely wipe out personal data on the device. We advise you to backup
your personal data before unlocking the bootloader. You can also backup
your installed apps and app data by using the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;adb</span> <span class="pre">backup</span> <span class="pre">-apk</span> <span class="pre">-all</span> <span class="pre">-f</span> <span class="pre">backup.ab&quot;</span></code> command, which creates a file
called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">backup.ab</span></code>. After unlocking the bootloader, you can restore
the data by running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;adb</span> <span class="pre">restore</span> <span class="pre">backup.ab&quot;</span></code>.
<strong>Figure&nbsp;6</strong> (b) shows the confirmation
screen, and <strong>Figure&nbsp;6</strong> (c) shows that the
bootloader is now unlocked.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 7: Custom Recovery OS</span></p>
</div>
<p>On real devices, to remove the restrictions imposed by the stock
recovery OS, such as signature verification, we have to replace it with
a custom recovery OS that does not impose such restrictions. A number of
custom recovery OSes are available on the market. TWRP and ClockworkMod
are two of the best choices. We are going to use TWRP in our
description. To flash custom recovery we need to unlock the bootloader
of the device. We assume that you have already unlocked the bootloader.
We can boot the custom Recovery OS by using the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;fastboot</span> <span class="pre">boot</span> <span class="pre">CustomRecoveryOS.img&quot;</span></code> command, or we can permanently
replace the device’s stock recovery OS with TWRP. The following command
flashing the custom recovery OS onto the recovery partition:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># fastboot flash recovery CustomRecoveryOS.img

OKAY [ 0.483s]
writing &#39;recovery&#39; ...
OKAY [ 0.948s]
finished. total time: 1.435s
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After that, we can boot into the recovery OS by pressing the “volume
down” and “power” button combination during the boot-up process.
<strong>Figure&nbsp;7</strong> (a) shows how to boot into
the recovery OS, and <strong>Figure&nbsp;7</strong> (b)
shows the user interface of the TWRP recovery OS. As you can see, it has
several useful features.</p>
